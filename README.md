# Webscraper

This project scrapes the name, ranking, and city of all U.S. Universities.  

The website we are getting our data from is from www.4icu.org. 

Description and type of data is below:

name    : Name of the University as a string.
ranking : Ranking of the University as a string.
city    : City the University is located in as a string.

The webscraper will return these values in a file named "output.csv"

This data will be used in my Real Estate Investing Application (RE-Invest).
